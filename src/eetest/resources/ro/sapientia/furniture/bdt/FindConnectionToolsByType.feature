Feature: Check if the find by type endpoints works

  @tag1
  Scenario: Multiple elements
    Given that we have the following connection tools:
	   | size  | type |
	   | 3 		 | sin |
	   | 4     | sarok |
	   | 5     | szeg |
   When I invoke the connectiontool find type endpoint
   Then I should get the size "1" for the number of the same type
